# TicTacToe
Create a TicTacToe with smart cpu

TicTacToe.py => human vs random cpu

TicTacToe_GameGenerator.py => quickly simulate a (human defined) number of games cpu vs cpu (random) to get multiple output to fit the model later one

game_output_viewer.py => display the output of the generated gamed cpu vs cpu with victory line in red to make sure there was no bugs

(Smart cpu: ongoing building process, only random for now)
